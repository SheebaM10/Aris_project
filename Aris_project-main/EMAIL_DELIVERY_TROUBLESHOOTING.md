## Why Emails Aren't Being Received 🔍

### 1. **MOST LIKELY: Spam/Junk Folder**
**Action Required:** Check the spam/junk folder of `shivani@karanji.com`
- Gmail often filters automated emails
- New sender reputation takes time to build
- HTML emails from unknown senders are often flagged

### 2. **Domain Delivery Issues**
The domain `karanji.com` might have email delivery restrictions:
- Check if the domain accepts external emails
- Verify DNS MX records are configured correctly
- Domain might have strict spam filtering

### 3. **Gmail Sending Reputation**
New Gmail accounts have limited sending reputation:
- Gmail might be delaying email delivery
- Recipients' servers might be treating emails as suspicious
- Need to establish sending reputation over time

### 4. **Email Content Triggers**
Automated emails with HTML content often trigger spam filters:
- Subject lines with "Update on..." might be flagged
- HTML emails from business accounts
- Lack of proper SPF/DKIM records

## Immediate Solutions 🚀

### Option 1: Check Spam Folder (Most Important)
1. **Ask the recipient** to check their spam/junk folder
2. If emails are there, mark them as "Not Spam"
3. Add `karanjibuddy@gmail.com` to contacts/whitelist

### Option 2: Test with Different Email
```bash
# Test with Gmail account for immediate verification
POST /api/email
{
  "to": "test@gmail.com",  // Use a Gmail account you control
  "subject": "ARIS Test Email",
  "message": "Testing email delivery",
  "type": "general"
}
```

### Option 3: Send Plain Text Test
```bash
# Send simple plain text email (less likely to be flagged)
POST /api/email-test-advanced
{
  "testEmail": "recipient@gmail.com",
  "runAllTests": false
}
```

### Option 4: Use Different Subject Lines
Avoid these spam trigger words:
- ❌ "Update on..."
- ❌ "URGENT"
- ❌ "FREE"
- ❌ "LIMITED TIME"

Use these instead:
- ✅ "Project Status Report"
- ✅ "Weekly Summary"
- ✅ "Team Communication"

## Long-term Solutions 🔧

### 1. **Set Up SPF Record**
Add to `karanji.com` DNS:
```
TXT record: "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all"
```

### 2. **Set Up DKIM**
Configure Gmail DKIM authentication:
1. Go to Google Admin Console
2. Apps → Google Workspace → Gmail → Authenticate email
3. Generate DKIM key
4. Add DKIM record to DNS

### 3. **Configure DMARC**
Add DMARC policy to DNS:
```
TXT record: "v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:admin@karanji.com"
```

### 4. **Use Professional Email Service**
Consider upgrading to:
- Google Workspace (paid Gmail)
- Microsoft 365
- SendGrid/Mailgun for transactional emails

## Testing Instructions 🧪

### Immediate Test (Do This Now):
1. **Send test email to your own Gmail account**:
   - Go to ARIS dashboard
   - Send email to your personal Gmail
   - Check if it arrives (should arrive within 1-2 minutes)

2. **If test email arrives**: Problem is with `karanji.com` domain
3. **If test email goes to spam**: Content/reputation issue
4. **If no test email**: Technical issue (contact me)

### Email Delivery Status Check:
```javascript
// Check Gmail sent folder
// Login to karanjibuddy@gmail.com
// Check "Sent" folder for sent emails
// Look for delivery status/bounce messages
```

## Quick Fix Implementation 💡

I can implement these immediate improvements:

1. **Better email headers** for improved deliverability
2. **Plain text alternative** to reduce spam flagging  
3. **Different subject line patterns** to avoid triggers
4. **Retry mechanism** with exponential backoff
5. **Multiple email service fallback** (SendGrid, etc.)
